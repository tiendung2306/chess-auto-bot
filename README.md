*Similar to lichess.org* <br>

## Thanks
This script is made from some libraries. In developing this script I am very grateful to:
1. [StockFish](https://stockfishchess.org/download/)
2. [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess)
## Disclaimer
**Keep in mind Chess.com and Lichess.org would ban you for playing against other players.** <br>
**Play only against bots!** <br>

This is purely for educational purposes, I am not responsible for misuse of the script. <br>

This was not meant to be used as cheating. You can already freely do so without this script. This was just so I could see how machine learning works and how I could implement it. I saw this as a really cool idea to have a script do something automatically. I've always liked these kinds of automation projects. This was not meant to be used as a cheating tool.
